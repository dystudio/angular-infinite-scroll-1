Another infinite scroll shit solution for AngularJS.

## Important Notes

Latest versions are still alpha and should not be used for production.

### Why another Infinite Scroll solution?

- [sroze/ngInfiniteScroll](https://github.com/sroze/ngInfiniteScroll) is an okay solution, however it seems to not support infinite scrolling for containers, and has oudated documentation.
- The author of the mentioned library is difficult to contact (no twitter, mail seems down, and busy according to his Github activity).
- Some part of the internal code just doesn't make sense to me.
- It Just Works™.
- Why not?
- I don't know at all.

One thing is that it's not better.

### Status

Current version is ```v0.0.1```.

**Todo**

- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Automation
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Immediate invocation (calling of callback, etc)
- [ ] Validation of properties passed to the isolate scope (proper error-trapping)
- [ ] Dynamic changes for ```callback``` (huh?), ```threshold```, ``throttle```, and ```container``` (whut)
- [ ] Removal of jQuery as dependency
- [ ] Support for responsive apps

## Getting Started

Should work with AngularJS ```>=v1.2.0```
